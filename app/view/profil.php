						Exporting can be a profitable way of expanding your business, spreading your 
						risks and reducing your dependence on the local market. Austrade research shows 
						that, on average, exporting companies are more profitable than their non-exporting 
						counterparts. Exporting exposes you to new ideas, management practices, marketing 
						techniques, and ways of competing that you wouldn't have experienced by staying at home. 
					</p>	
					<p>	
						All this considerably improves your ability to compete in the domestic market as well. 
						By going overseas, you can become more efficient and increase your productivity. 
						Exporting companies have better growth prospects, highly skilled, highly productive 
						staff and tend to adapt technology and best practice techniques faster. Even if you have a 
						limited domestic market, you should think about exporting - 
						around a quarter of new exporters are born globals. Global brands can be built from small 
						local companies especially in rural and regional Australia. This section will guide 
						you step-by-step through exporting
